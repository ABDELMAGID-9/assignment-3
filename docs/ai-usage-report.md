# 🤖 AI Usage Report – Assignment 3

## 🧠 Overview
This document explains how Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were used throughout the development of **Assignment 3 – Advanced Functionality Portfolio**.  
AI was used ethically and responsibly to assist with problem-solving, debugging, and documentation — not to replace understanding or learning.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

| AI Tool | Purpose / Usage | Type |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** | Provided guidance, code suggestions, and debugging help while implementing project features (GitHub API integration, form validation, theme toggle, and localStorage logic). | Conversational AI |
| **GitHub Copilot (optional)** | Offered small inline suggestions for cleaner syntax and variable naming during coding. | Code Assistant |
| **VS Code IntelliSense** | Assisted in spotting syntax errors and quick completions. | Built-in AI Support |

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

### 1. **Project Planning**
AI helped outline the project structure and decide on core features such as:
- API integration (GitHub Repositories)
- Contact form with validation
- Session timer and theme toggle

### 2. **Code Generation**
- ChatGPT provided boilerplate examples for API fetch requests using `async/await`.
- Helped structure functions for **theme switching** and **show/hide projects**.

### 3. **Debugging & Problem Solving**
- Assisted in identifying why the light/dark mode wasn’t toggling correctly (missing CSS variables).
- Fixed email validation regex and logic to prevent false positives.
- Helped manage `localStorage` updates when user changes their name.

### 4. **Documentation Writing**
- ChatGPT assisted in drafting this report and the main `README.md`, which was later edited manually for clarity and personal tone.

## ⚙️ Prompts Example

| Purpose | Example Prompt |
|----------|----------------|
| Fix logic | “Why is my dark/light toggle not switching themes properly in JavaScript?” |
| Add feature | “How do I add a button that hides and shows a list of fetched GitHub projects?” |
| Improve documentation | “Write a professional README section explaining how to run my portfolio project with Live Server.” |

## 🧾 Modifications Made by Me
Even though AI generated parts of the code, I:
- Manually refactored functions for simplicity and readability.
- Verified all JavaScript logic and comments.
- Rewrote text output and adjusted styles to match my design.
- Added additional validation and UX improvements manually.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
- AI was used **responsibly** as a learning aid — not for automatic project completion.  
- Every piece of code was tested, understood, and refined manually.  
- AI-generated content was always reviewed for accuracy and originality.

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
By using AI tools during this project, I learned to:
- Use AI suggestions critically instead of copying blindly.
- Debug faster and understand JavaScript error handling.
- Write clearer and more professional documentation.
- Balance automation with personal creativity and technical reasoning.

---

## ✅ Summary
AI tools helped speed up the development and documentation process, but the logic, structure, and design of the project were implemented and fully understood by me.
