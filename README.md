# 🌟 Assignment 3 – Advanced Functionality Portfolio

This project represents the **third stage** of my personal portfolio web application.
It showcases advanced web development skills including **JavaScript logic**, **external API integration**, **state management**, and **AI-assisted coding**.
The goal is to demonstrate the ability to build an interactive, professional, and efficient front-end application using only vanilla technologies.

## 🎯 Project Description

The portfolio web app includes the following interactive features:

* **GitHub API Integration** → Fetch and display live GitHub repositories by username.
* **Show / Hide Projects** → A toggle button to dynamically hide or show fetched repositories.
* **Dark / Light Theme Toggle** → Theme preference saved in `localStorage`.
* **Personalized Greeting** → Prompts the user for their name and remembers it for later visits.
* **Contact Form with Validation** → Validates inputs for required fields, email correctness, and message length before submission.
* **Session Timer** → Counts how long the user has been on the page.

All features are built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, emphasizing clean code, structure, and interactivity.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these simple steps to view and test the project:

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ABDELMAGID-9/assignment-3.git](https://github.com/ABDELMAGID-9/assignment-3.git)
    cd assignment-3
    ```

2.  **Open the folder in Visual Studio Code**

3.  **Install the Live Server extension**
    * Go to the **Extensions** tab in VS Code.
    * Search for **“Live Server”** by Ritwick Dey and install it.

4.  **Run the project**
    * Once installed, click the **“Go Live”** button at the bottom-right corner of VS Code.
    * The project will open in your default browser (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).

That’s it — your portfolio site will be live locally!

### 💡 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Semantic, accessible markup
* **CSS3** – Modern styling and responsive design
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** – Dynamic logic and API handling
* **GitHub REST API** – External data integration
* **LocalStorage API** – Persistent user settings (theme and greeting)
* **VS Code + Live Server** – Local development environment

### 🤖 AI Tools Used

This project was created with assistance from AI tools to improve workflow, readability, and structure.

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** | Helped plan logic, refine code, debug issues, and improve documentation. |
| **GitHub Copilot (optional)** | Provided inline code suggestions while writing JavaScript. |

Full AI usage documentation, including prompts, outputs, and learning outcomes, is detailed in `docs/ai-usage-report.md`.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I learned to:

* Integrate real-time APIs into front-end projects.
* Manage application state using the browser’s local storage.
* Implement dynamic form validation and feedback.
* Apply best practices for accessibility, responsiveness, and readability.
* Use AI as a development assistant responsibly and effectively.
